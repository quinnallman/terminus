# terminus

Terminus is an incremental RPG in the style of Realm of Decay, with many aspects of modern MMORPGs. You can kill monsters manually or automatically and claim the loot they drop. You can equip that loot to make yourself stronger, allowing you to take on bigger challenges.

Version 0.5.2 is now available. Play it here: http://quinnallman.github.io/terminus/
